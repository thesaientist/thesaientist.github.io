## Setup for website
This is the base setup for my blog, using GitHub pages for hosting the repository of the site's content and Jekyll static site generator for designing the interface. The theme I use is `minima`, which is the default theme used when creating a new Jekyll site and also the best minimalist theme for my needs that I've found among the supported themes. For a list of GitHub Pages supported themes, see [Supported Themes](https://pages.github.com/themes/).

I found the following resources helpful in creating my site:
* [Getting started with GitHub Pages](https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/getting-started-with-github-pages)
* [Setting up a new site with Jekyll and Bundler](https://jekyllrb.com/tutorials/using-jekyll-with-bundler/)

It's best to use a macOS (what I used) or Linux operating system to set up the website, because Windows is not officially supported for Jekyll. I tried on Windows initially, but ran into a lot of permission and dependency errors, so I don't recommend it unless you only have access to a Windows system. If you're attempting to set up your own site and run into issues, I can definitely try to help. Reach out to me at <therealsaientist@gmail.com>.
